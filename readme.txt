Force logout users from your site.

== Description ==

WPForce Logout allows you (administators) to forcefully logout all or selected users with a simple click.

If you suspect that your WordPress site is hacked, then forcing logout will allow you to properly clean up your hacked WordPress site. Next, if you are using a membership or pay per view site and fear that users may be sharing their passwords to access content, then this plugin will come in handy. If you need to work on your WordPress website without any users being logged in, you can force all user accounts to be logged out. Credit: description content taken from wpbeginner's article.
